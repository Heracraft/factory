// The live suite. Unlike playwright.config.ts it starts nothing: the site
// under test is already deployed, and REPOSE_LIVE_URL points at it
// (https://repose.herakraft.co by default, a staging deploy otherwise).
//
// Two projects, because one half needs a real GitHub sign-in and the other
// does not:
//
//   public   — everything a signed-out visitor sees, plus the sign-in
//              redirect into the real Logto. Always runs.
//   account  — the signed-in pages, using the browser state saved by
//              `pnpm run live:auth`. Skipped with a message when that state
//              is absent, rather than failing, so `pnpm run live` is
//              useful to anyone without the owner's account.
//
// Nothing here mutates production: the account project reads pages and
// asserts on controls (the delete-account button's disabled state, for
// one), and never presses a destructive one.
