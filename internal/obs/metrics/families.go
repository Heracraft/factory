// The api and gateway metric families of
// docs/workstreams/10-observability.md §5 live here rather than in
// internal/api and internal/gateway because this workstream owns metric
// names and those two binaries are built later (workstreams 05 and 06). A
// family defined here is a family they cannot accidentally rename: the test
// in metrics_test.go asserts every name and label of §5, and the dashboards
// and alert rules under ops/ query exactly these series.
//
// hostd's family is in internal/hostd/metrics, registered through the same
// checked registry.
//
// The api's family lived here until workstream 05 merged with its own
// implementation of the same names in internal/api/metrics; one
// implementation is the rule, so this package keeps only the gateway's, and
// families_api_test.go holds 05's to §5 (DECISIONS I-59). Two series in it are
// not in §5's list because §5's alert table and failure modes ask for them:
// repose_api_egress_alert_projects (the EgressHigh input, which cannot be a
// per-project series) and repose_api_partition_drop_fail_total (the §6 failure
// mode that says the api "logs partition_drop_fail and alerts").

// gatewayRouteBuckets: a route lookup over a second is a bug, so the high
// buckets exist only to keep the +Inf bucket from swallowing the tail.
