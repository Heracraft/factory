# infra

Every cloud resource repose needs, declared here and created by `tofu apply`,
so that a new host, a replacement edge or a rebuilt control plane is a
reviewed diff rather than a remembered sequence of portal clicks.

Azure holds compute and storage only. Everything else in the system is
provider-agnostic on purpose (`docs/DESIGN.md` §16), so a Hetzner host module
is an addition here rather than a rewrite of anything else. The workstream
document is `docs/workstreams/11-infra-opentofu.md`.

```

```

Never commit `*.tfstate` or `*.local.tfvars`. `.terraform.lock.hcl` **is**
committed, deliberately: it is what makes a plan in CI resolve the same
provider versions as a plan on a laptop.

## Before anything

`docs/ops/AZURE-SETUP.md` lists the one-time human steps: subscription and
quota, resource providers, the `repose-prod` resource group, the state storage
account, `az login`, a budget alert, an SSH key, the Cloudflare and Logto
setup. Steps 1 to 9 must be done before the first apply here.

Tools come from the dev shell. `nix develop ./nix` has `tofu`, `az` and
`nixos-anywhere`; `nix develop ./nix#infra` adds `tfsec` for `make policy`.

Two environment values are read from the environment rather than a file:

```bash
az login                                # OpenTofu's Azure credentials
export CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN=...         # only when manage_dns is true
```

## Values: what is committed and what is not

`prod.tfvars` holds the values that belong in review: sizes, disk sizes,
account names, the host list. `prod.local.tfvars` (git-ignored; copy
`prod.local.tfvars.example`) holds the values that are per-operator or
secret: which addresses may reach operator SSH, the operator public keys, the
path to the private key, the Cloudflare zone id and the join tokens. The
Makefile passes both when the second exists.

## Bootstrap

Production's resource group and state storage account were created by hand on
2026-09-19 (`docs/ops/AZURE-SETUP.md` steps 4 and 5) and are **not** managed
by OpenTofu: an apply that could destroy the state container could destroy the
state describing it (`docs/DECISIONS.md` I-20). `infra/bootstrap` describes
that shape anyway, so a second environment is one command:

```bash
make bootstrap ENV=staging
```

which creates `repose-staging` and keeps its state in production's account
under the key `staging.tfstate`. The `tofu import` commands for adopting
production's existing resources are at the top of `bootstrap/main.tf`; running
them is a deliberate decision, not a step in this list.

State locking is a blob lease. Versioning is on, so a corrupted state file is
restored from the previous blob version.

## Order of the first apply

The pieces depend on each other in one direction only:

1. **Edge first.** Hosts have no public IP, so every provisioner reaches them
   through the edge, and the module graph enforces that.
2. **Control plane.** Independent of hosts; its WireGuard peer needs the
   edge's public key, which does not exist until the edge is installed, so
   the first apply leaves its tunnel down (below).
3. **Hosts**, one at a time, each with a join token.

```bash
make plan  ENV=prod        # read it
make apply ENV=prod
```

The plan for an environment with `hosts = []` creates the network, the NAT
gateway, the snapshot account, the Key Vault, the edge and the control plane,
and nothing else.

## How the installer reaches a host

Through the edge, always. `nixos-anywhere`, the post-install `/dev/kvm` and
nested-virtualization checks, and the join-token delivery all connect to the
host's **private** address with the edge as an SSH jump host, and the module
graph makes every host depend on the edge having been installed first.

Hosts never get a public IP, not even a temporary one for the install
(`docs/DECISIONS.md` I-25). A public IP would need an inbound rule on the
hosts subnet, which is the one thing `policy/tfsec` forbids; the install
window is about ten minutes, not seconds; and what would be sitting in it is a
stock Ubuntu image accepting root SSH.

```
you (operator_cidrs) ──ssh──▶ edge :<edge_operator_ssh_port> ──ssh──▶ host :22
```

Two things have to be true for that to work, and both are worth checking
before the first apply:

- **Your address is in `operator_cidrs`.** The edge NSG opens the operator
  SSH port to that list and to the VNet, nothing else.
- **The edge's sshd is on `edge_operator_ssh_port`.** It defaults to 2222,
  because 22 belongs to the user-facing SSH gateway. The wave-one edge served
  sshd on 22 and the first apply set `edge_operator_ssh_port = 22`; the M2
  edge deploy (2026-09-20, DECISIONS I-92) moved it to 2222, and a local
  tfvars that still says 22 makes every host provisioner fail on the
  gateway's `certificate required` banner.

The host side needs nothing configured: Azure's built-in `AllowVnetInBound`
rule is what lets the edge reach a host's sshd, which is why the hosts NSG can
have no rules of its own at all.

The provisioner shape this rests on — bastion connection, `install -d` then a
`file` provisioner then `remote-exec` — was exercised against a real sshd on
2026-09-19: the token arrived at mode 0600 and its contents appear nowhere in
the apply log, because it travels as file content and never as an argument.

## Adding a host

```bash
# M1, before the api exists: the one-host dev driver mints it (DECISIONS I-17)
hostdev init --host host-02                              # prints a token
# once the api is up:
# repose-admin hosts add --name host-02 --provider azure
```

Then:

1. Add `"host-02"` to `hosts` in `azure/prod/prod.tfvars`, in a commit
   somebody reads.
2. Add `host-02 = "<token>"` to `join_tokens` in `prod.local.tfvars`.
3. `make plan ENV=prod`, read it, `make apply ENV=prod`.

The apply creates the VM and its data disk, installs NixOS with
nixos-anywhere through the edge, checks that `/dev/kvm` exists and that
`kvm_intel` nested is `Y`, writes the token to `/run/repose/join-token` and
restarts `hostd`. `repose-admin hosts list` shows `ready` within about two
minutes of the reboot; if it does not, the runbook entry is
"Host never registered".

Leave the spent token in `prod.local.tfvars`. It is single-use and expires in
24 hours, so a stale entry is inert, and leaving it keeps later plans from
proposing to remove the delivery step. Replacing its value is how a token is
rotated.

The whole thing takes roughly ten minutes, most of it the kexec and the
closure copy.

## Rotating a join token

A host that never registered, or one whose token was seen by someone:

```bash
hostdev init --host host-02 --reissue                 # new token (M1)
# repose-admin hosts add --name host-02 --reissue      # once the api exists
# replace the value in prod.local.tfvars
make apply ENV=prod
```

Only the token-delivery step re-runs; the VM is not touched. By hand, the same
thing is the runbook's "Host never registered": write the token to
`/run/repose/join-token` over the edge jump and `systemctl restart hostd`.

The token never travels as a command-line argument, so it is not in the apply
log, and it lands on a tmpfs, so it is not on the disk
(`docs/DECISIONS.md` I-19).

## The control plane

`coolify_count = 1` creates it: an Ubuntu `Standard_D4s_v7` with a 256 GB
Premium OS disk and a static public IP in the `control` subnet. It is a
**server** of the owner's existing Coolify instance, not a Coolify install of
its own (`docs/DECISIONS.md` I-83): that instance connects over SSH as root,
installs its proxy, and deploys the api, the dashboard, Logto and the platform
Postgres onto it. It stays Ubuntu because Coolify rejects NixOS as a managed
server (`docs/DECISIONS.md` R4-2), which is why this is the one machine here
that `nix/` knows nothing about.

cloud-init leaves the VM as Coolify's "Validate & configure" expects to find
it: root login by key, with the operator keys and the instance's own key
(`coolify_public_key`, a public key, in `prod.tfvars`) in
`/root/.ssh/authorized_keys`; Docker Engine and the compose plugin from
Docker's apt repository; Tailscale, installed but not joined, so that the
owner's Coolify reaches the VM by a tailnet address instead of a public-IP
rule that goes stale (`docs/DECISIONS.md` I-86); `rclone` and `pg_restore`,
because those are the
first two commands of `docs/ops/RUNBOOK.md` "Postgres restore" and a restore
that stops to install something is a restore nobody has rehearsed; the
WireGuard peer script; and nothing listening but sshd. The apply does not
return until `terraform_data.ready` has checked each of those over SSH.

**Two address lists must be right.** The machine running `tofu apply` must be
in `operator_cidrs`: the readiness provisioner reaches the VM over its public
IP on 22, and from anywhere else the apply looks like a fifteen-minute hang
rather than a refusal. The owner's Coolify instance reaches the VM over
Tailscale and needs no rule; a Coolify that is not on the tailnet goes in
`coolify_manager_cidrs` (`prod.local.tfvars`), which the control NSG adds to
the same port-22 rule, and without it that validation times out and looks
like a dead machine.

**There is no port 8000.** Coolify's dashboard is the owner's instance, not
this VM; `azure/modules/network/main.tf` carries a `postcondition` that fails
the plan if 8000, 6001, 6002 or `*` ever appears as an inbound rule on the
control subnet. 80 and 443 are open to `control_web_cidrs` for the proxy
Coolify installs on the server, which terminates TLS for the two names in
"DNS" below.

Everything past the VM is a click path Coolify keeps in its own database, not
in state: `docs/ops/coolify.md` is that path, including adding the server and
the one fact that ruins a restore if it is learned late — Coolify encrypts its
stored credentials with `APP_KEY` from the `.env` on the owner's Coolify host,
so a Postgres dump without that key restores a database of ciphertext.
Backups and restores are Coolify's own, against a destination the owner
configures there; nothing in this repository touches them (DECISIONS I-112).

Setting `coolify_count` back to 0 destroys the VM and its OS disk, the
platform Postgres included; Coolify's own definitions of the resources
survive on the owner's instance, pointing at a server that no longer exists.
The retention that matters is Coolify's own backup plus the owner's `.env`.

## DNS

`manage_dns` defaults to **false**, because the records need a
`CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN` in the environment and a `cloudflare_zone_id`, and a
plan without them fails inside the provider with an authentication error that
names neither. With a token:

```bash
export CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN=...
# cloudflare_zone_id = "..." and manage_dns = true in the local tfvars
make plan ENV=prod
```

The records are created in the same apply as the addresses they point at, so a
name never outlives the IP it names, and `infra/dns` refuses to proxy anything
under `ssh.`: Cloudflare's proxy carries neither SSH nor WireGuard.

### DNS while manage_dns is false

**"No record" is not "no answer" here.** `herakraft.co` serves every name
under it from a proxied wildcard, so with `manage_dns` off the repose names
resolve to Cloudflare's proxy rather than failing:

```
$ dig +short ssh.repose.herakraft.co
172.67.175.123
104.21.31.82                       # Cloudflare, not the edge (2026-09-20)
```

A user following the documented `ssh ssh.repose.herakraft.co` reaches
Cloudflare's proxy, which does not carry SSH, and every host configured with
that hostname as its WireGuard endpoint fails the same way. The environment
module raises this as a plan-time warning (`check "dns_is_managed_or_manual"`)
rather than letting it be discovered from a connection that hangs.

Until a token exists, create these by hand in the Cloudflare dashboard, as
**A records with the proxy off**, and delete them in the same change that sets
`manage_dns = true` so OpenTofu can create them itself:

| Name | Points at | Proxy | Why |
|---|---|---|---|
| `ssh.repose` | `edge_public_ip` output | **off** | SSH gateway and every host's WireGuard endpoint; the proxy carries neither |
| `repose` | `control_public_ip` output | off | dashboard; the proxy Coolify installs on the server terminates TLS |
| `api.repose` | `control_public_ip` output | off | proxying hides client addresses from the api's rate limits |

## Wiring the control plane to the edge

The control-plane VM generates its own WireGuard key at first boot and never
hands the private half to anybody, so the peering is two moves, one on each
side:

1. **The edge side** is configuration: the VM's public key
   (`ssh root@<control ip> cat /etc/wireguard/publickey`) goes into
   `nix/edge/edge-01.nix` as a `repose.edge.staticPeers` entry with
   `allowedIPs = [ "10.255.255.1/32" ]`, and the edge is rebuilt. `wgsync`
   never removes a static peer (DECISIONS I-92).
2. **The VM side** is `/etc/wireguard/wg0.conf`. cloud-init writes it from
   `edge_wireguard_public_key` only when the VM is *created*: the VM's
   `custom_data` is in `ignore_changes`, so setting the variable later
   changes nothing on a live machine. On a live VM write the peer by hand,
   exactly what `repose-wg-setup` would have written:

   ```bash
   ssh -p 2222 root@<edge ip> cat /var/lib/repose/edge/wg.pub   # the edge's key
   ssh root@<control ip> 'umask 077; cat > /etc/wireguard/wg0.conf <<CONF
   [Interface]
   Address = 10.255.255.1/16
   PostUp = wg set %i private-key /etc/wireguard/privatekey

   [Peer]
   PublicKey = <edge public key>
   Endpoint = <edge ip>:51820
   AllowedIPs = 10.255.0.0/16, 10.64.0.0/12
   PersistentKeepalive = 25
   CONF
   systemctl enable --now wg-quick@wg0 && wg show'
   ```

   Keep `edge_wireguard_public_key` in `prod.local.tfvars` anyway, so a
   replacement control VM comes up peered.

What travels over the tunnel: the edge reaches the api's `/internal` and
gRPC listeners at `10.255.255.1:8444` and `:8443` (the `api-grpc` app's port
mappings, `ops/coolify/README.md`), and the monitoring server, once it is a
peer too, scrapes the api's metrics there. Hosts do **not** use it to reach
the api: they dial `control_private_ip:8443` on the VNet, because a host
registers before it has a tunnel (DECISIONS I-92).

## Draining and destroying a host

Shrinking the `hosts` list destroys a VM and everything on it. Do this, in
order:

1. `repose-admin hosts drain host-02` — the scheduler places nothing new.
2. Move or stop every project on it: `repose-admin projects move` for each,
   or let tenants stop them. `repose-admin hosts list --json` shows the count.
3. `repose-admin hosts retire host-02`.
4. Remove the name from `hosts` in `prod.tfvars`.
5. The data disk and its attachment carry `prevent_destroy`, so the plan will
   fail. That is the point. Delete the `prevent_destroy = true` lines in
   `azure/modules/host/main.tf` in a commit somebody reads, apply, and put
   them back.

Step 5 is friction on purpose: a host's data disk holds every tenant volume on
that host, and the mistake it prevents is a one-character edit to a list.

## Recovering from a stuck state lease

An apply that was killed leaves a lease on the state blob and the next one
says `Error acquiring the state lock` with an ID. So does a **plan** that lost
its connection to Azure Resource Manager mid-refresh: this happened twice from
the dev box on 2026-09-20, with `context deadline exceeded` on a single
resource read followed by `Error releasing the state lock`.

"Confirm nobody is running an apply" does not have to be a guess. The lock
blob's metadata records which operation took it, from where, and when:

```bash
az storage blob metadata show --account-name reposetfstate3912 \
  --container-name tfstate --name azure.tfstate --auth-mode login \
  --query terraformlockid -o tsv | base64 -d
# {"ID":"946e71cf-...","Operation":"OperationTypePlan","Who":"azureuser@woker-1",
#  "Created":"2026-09-20T04:16:35Z",...}
```

`OperationTypePlan` from a machine where no `tofu` process is alive is safe to
break; `OperationTypeApply` from somewhere you cannot see is not.

```bash
make force-unlock ENV=prod LOCK_ID=<the id from the message>
```

If the state file itself is wrong, the container has blob versioning:
`az storage blob list --account-name reposetfstate3912 --container-name
tfstate --include v` shows the versions, and
`az storage blob copy start` from a version restores it.

## Checks

```bash
make check                 # fmt-check + validate (all roots) + tfsec
make plan ENV=staging      # costs nothing; a plan creates nothing
```

`policy/tfsec/repose_tfchecks.yaml` holds two rules:

- **REPOSE-NET-001**: the NSG named `nsg-hosts` must have no security rules.
  Hosts have no inbound (`docs/DESIGN.md` §4, §7); Azure's built-in
  `AllowVnetInBound` already lets the edge's jump connection through, so an
  explicit rule here is always a mistake.
- **REPOSE-VM-001/002**: no VM may set `secure_boot_enabled` or
  `vtpm_enabled`. Trusted Launch disables nested virtualization, and a host
  with no `/dev/kvm` boots perfectly and serves nothing.

tfsec is in maintenance upstream; trivy is its successor. Two checks is a
small enough surface to port when that day comes.

## Cost

Re-checked on **2026-09-20**, the date of the first apply, against the Azure
Retail Prices API (`https://prices.azure.com/api/retail/prices`,
`armRegionName eq 'eastus'`, `priceType eq 'Consumption'`), for what
`prod.tfvars` actually creates: one `D16s_v7` host with a 512 GB Premium SSD
v2 data disk (DECISIONS I-14, I-39), the edge, and **the control-plane VM**
(`coolify_count = 1`, DECISIONS I-71). 730 hours to the month, Linux rates, no
reservation.

| Resource | Unit price | Monthly |
|---|---|---|
| Host `Standard_D16s_v7` | $1.058/h | $772.34 |
| Host OS disk, Premium SSD P15 (256 GiB) + mount | $38.01 + $1.83 | $39.84 |
| Host data disk, Premium SSD v2, 512 GiB | $0.00011/GiB/h | $41.12 |
| — its 16,000 IOPS (3,000 free) | $0.000007/IOPS/h | $66.43 |
| — its 600 MB/s (125 free) | $0.000055/MBps/h | $19.07 |
| NAT gateway | $0.045/h + $0.045/GB processed | $32.85 + egress |
| Edge `Standard_D2s_v7` | $0.132/h | $96.36 |
| Edge OS disk, Premium SSD P6 (64 GiB) + mount | $10.21 + $0.47 | $10.68 |
| Two Standard static IPv4 (NAT, edge) | $0.005/h each | $7.30 |
| Blob, 500 GB of snapshots, Cool LRS | $0.0152/GB/month | $7.60 |
| Key Vault standard, operations | $0.03 per 10K | under $1 |
| **Subtotal, one host and the edge, before egress** | | **about $857** |
| Control plane `Standard_D4s_v7` | $0.265/h | $193.45 |
| — its OS disk, Premium SSD P15 (256 GiB) + mount | $38.01 + $1.83 | $39.84 |
| — its static IPv4 | $0.005/h | $3.65 |
| **Total, one host and the control plane, before egress** | | **about $1,094** |

**The 2026-09-19 table had the control plane $53 a month too cheap.** It
listed the `D4s_v7` at $140.16 a month; the API returns $0.265 an hour, which
is $193.45. The re-query above is what caught it, which is the whole reason
this item is on the checklist and dated.

So the control plane is about **$237** a month, and one host plus the control
plane is about **$1,094** — over the $1,000 monthly budget alert in
`docs/ops/AZURE-SETUP.md` step 7. Raise the budget to $1,200, or drop the
control plane to a `D2s_v7` (2 vCPU, 8 GB) and save $97. Coolify, Logto,
Postgres, the api and the dashboard on 8 GB is tight but not absurd for a
month of testing alone; 16 GB is the size that does not need thinking about.

The other thing this table says that the earlier estimate did not:
**Premium SSD v2 provisioned performance is most of the disk bill.** Capacity
is $41; the IOPS and throughput above the free tier are another $85.
`host_data_disk_iops` and `host_data_disk_mbps` are variables for exactly that
reason, and both can be raised in place later without downtime, so the first
host can start at the free tier (3,000 IOPS, 125 MB/s) and save $85 a month
until there is a guest whose builds justify more.

At launch sizes (`Standard_D64s_v7`, 2 TB data disk, control plane on) the
same table totals about **$2,850**. The $10k credit funds roughly three and a
half months of that with one host. Reservations generally cannot be bought
with sponsorship credits; check before assuming a reserved rate applies.

One figure is not from the API: Azure does not expose a NAT Gateway meter
under any `serviceName` in `eastus` that the retail endpoint will return, so
$0.045 per hour and $0.045 per GB processed are the published rates, not
queried ones.

## What is deliberately not here

- **The NixOS configurations.** `nix/hosts` and `nix/edge` are workstreams 01
  and 06; this only invokes them.
- **Coolify's application definitions.** Coolify keeps them in its own
  database, which no `tofu plan` can read or diff; the click path is
  `docs/ops/coolify.md`, with the short form in `docs/ops/RUNBOOK.md`
  "Control plane".
- **The api's Entra app registration and client certificate.** A credential:
  creating it is a human step next to the other identity setup in
  `docs/ops/AZURE-SETUP.md`, and it does not belong in a state file
  (`docs/DECISIONS.md` I-21). Pass the app's object id as
  `api_identity_object_id` and the Key Vault wrap/unwrap policy appears.
- **Postgres backups.** Coolify's, to a destination in the owner's own
  Coolify. No bucket, no token, no schedule here (DECISIONS I-112).
- **A Hetzner module.** Designed for in `docs/workstreams/11-infra-opentofu.md`
  §5, not built. The `host` module's variable surface (`name`, `join_token`,
  `class`, `data_disk_gb`) and its outputs (`private_ip`, `ssh_jump`) are the
  contract a second provider implements.
- **Automatic capacity.** Capacity is added by a human at an 80 percent memory
  alert (`docs/DECISIONS.md` R3-5).

## Notes for the workstreams this hands off to

- **01 host-nixos.** The v7 sizes are NVMe-only (DECISIONS I-39): the OS
  disk is `/dev/nvme0n1`; the data disk (attached at LUN 10) is found at
  install time by the disko layout's Azure hook as the one NVMe disk that is
  not the OS disk, `/dev/disk/repose/data` (I-41), and the post-install
  check asserts `/dev/vg-guests/thin` exists. `nixos-anywhere` destroys
  whatever is at the OS path.
- **01 host-nixos.** `hostd.service` is the unit name this configuration
  restarts after writing a join token, taken from
  `docs/interfaces/host-conventions.md`. If the unit is named differently,
  set `hostd_unit` rather than renaming anything.
- **06 gateway-edge.** The edge subnet NSG opens 22, 443 and 51820/udp to the
  internet and the operator SSH port to `operator_cidrs` and the VNet, which
  is exactly the port list in `docs/workstreams/06-gateway-edge.md` §5.1. The
  operator sshd must be on 2222, because every host provisioner jumps through
  it while 22 belongs to the user gateway.
