# The control-plane VM: Logto, Postgres, and the api and dashboard as
# single-container Coolify applications (DECISIONS R4-2, R5-11), deployed onto
# it by the owner's existing Coolify instance, which manages this machine as a
# server over SSH (DECISIONS I-83). Coolify itself does not run here.
#
# Unlike the host and the edge this VM stays Ubuntu and is never touched by
# nixos-anywhere, because Coolify rejects NixOS as a managed server.
