-- Monthly partitions for meter_samples and proc_samples, and the drop that
-- makes the retention in docs/ops/OBSERVABILITY.md real: meter_samples 90
-- days, proc_samples 30 days.
--
-- Why partitions and not `delete from ... where ts < ...`: these two tables
-- are the only ones that grow with time rather than with users. At 60-second
-- samples, a hundred projects write 4.3 million meter_samples rows a month
-- and far more proc_samples; a monthly `delete` of that would rewrite the
-- indexes and hold locks on the table the rollup reads. Dropping a partition
-- is instant and gives the space back.
--
-- Who runs this: nobody, in production. The api does the same work in Go
-- (`db.EnsurePartitions` and `db.DropExpiredPartitions`, called at start and
-- by its daily job, logging `partition_drop_fail` and counting
-- `repose_api_partition_drop_fail_total` when it fails: the §6 failure mode
-- where disk grows and nothing else breaks). This file is the operator's
-- version of it — a psql session on a control plane whose api is down, and
-- the fixture ops/dev/pgcheck.sh exercises so that a retention that never
-- deletes anything cannot pass unnoticed.
--
-- Idempotent throughout: every create is `if not exists`, and the drop only
-- touches partitions whose whole range is older than the retention.

-- The tables themselves are created partitioned by the migration
-- (docs/interfaces/db-schema.md); this file assumes:
--
--   create table meter_samples (...) partition by range (ts);
--   create table proc_samples  (...) partition by range (ts);
