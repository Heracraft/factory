# 08-dashboard.md §9 and 05-control-plane-api.md ask for the same evidence in
# the same words: "deploy twice while curl loops against the domain, zero
# non-200 responses". This is that loop, with the counting done for you, so
# the evidence is a summary somebody can paste rather than 3000 lines of
# curl output that nobody reads to the end.
#
# It writes one line per request to the log file and prints a summary on
# exit (also on Ctrl-C, which is how you stop it when the deploys are done).
# A non-200, a timeout and a connection refusal are all failures and all
# keep their timestamp, because "which second did it break in" is the only
# question worth asking afterwards.
