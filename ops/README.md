# ops

Everything the owner's personal server needs in order to watch repose, and a
local stack that looks the same with no data in it. The design is
`docs/workstreams/10-observability.md`; how to use it in an incident is
`docs/ops/OBSERVABILITY.md` and `docs/ops/RUNBOOK.md`.

Nothing here runs on a host or on the control plane. Hosts run Fluent Bit,
node_exporter and hostd's own `/metrics` (`nix/hosts/`); this directory is the
other end of those.

| Path | What it is |
|---|---|
| `alerts.yaml` | The 21 Prometheus alert rules. Every name is a heading in `docs/ops/RUNBOOK.md`. |
| `alerts_test.yaml` | `promtool test rules` cases: each alert fires on the series it was written for and stays quiet just below it. |
| `alertmanager/repose-route.yaml` | Route and inhibitions for the owner's ntfy topics; `page` has its own receiver. |
| `prometheus/prometheus.yml` | Scrape config: hosts (`:9100`, `:9101`, Fluent Bit `:2021`), edge (`:9102`), api (`:9103`), all over WireGuard. |
| `prometheus/targets/hosts.yml` | The host list, re-read every minute. Adding a host is one edit here. |
| `prometheus/wireguard-peer.conf` | How the monitoring server joins the edge's WireGuard hub, and how to check it. |
| `loki/retention.yaml` | 90 days for component logs, 30 for guest console logs, with the compactor that makes it happen. |
| `grafana/provisioning/` | Datasources (three fixed uids) and the dashboard provider. |
| `dashboards/*.json` | The eight dashboards. Generated: edit `dashboards/gen.py` and re-run it. |
| `dashboards/gen.py` | The dashboards' source of truth. `--check` fails if the JSON is stale. |
| `dashboards/push.py` | Imports every dashboard into a real Grafana, in one folder, rewriting the dev datasource uids to the target's. Idempotent; the token comes from `GRAFANA_TOKEN`. |
| `dashboards/validate.py` | Structure, datasource uids, forbidden Prometheus labels, SQL against `db-schema.md`, and `--query` to see which panels have data. |
| `sql/partitions.sql` | The operator's copy of the partition maintenance the api does in Go: create this month and next, drop what is past retention. |
| `check.sh` | Everything above that can be checked without a host. `--grafana` also loads the dashboards into a real Grafana. |
| `dev/` | Prometheus, Loki, Grafana and Postgres in Docker, plus `seedmetrics`, `seedlogs.sh` and `pgcheck.sh`. |

## Installing it on the personal server

1. **WireGuard.** Add the monitoring server as a peer of the edge
   (`prometheus/wireguard-peer.conf`, both halves). Until this works nothing
   else can: hosts have no inbound and no public address.
2. **Prometheus.** Copy `prometheus/prometheus.yml` to
   `/etc/prometheus/prometheus.yml`, `alerts.yaml` and `prometheus/targets/`
   to `/etc/prometheus/repose/`, and run it with
   `--storage.tsdb.retention.time=90d`. Check `up{job=~"hosts|hostd"}`.
3. **Alertmanager.** Merge `alertmanager/repose-route.yaml` into
   `alertmanager.yml`. Check delivery by silencing nothing and stopping a
   host's `fluent-bit` for half an hour, or with `amtool`.
4. **Loki.** Merge `loki/retention.yaml`. Retention does nothing without the
   compactor, so check `curl -s localhost:3100/config | grep retention`.
5. **Grafana.** Provisioning from `grafana/provisioning/`, dashboards from
   `dashboards/` mounted at `/etc/grafana/dashboards/repose`. Create the
   read-only Postgres role in the datasource file's comment first, or the four
   Postgres-backed dashboards are empty.
6. **Postgres.** Nothing to install: the api creates and drops the sample
   tables' partitions itself. `sql/partitions.sql` is the same maintenance as
   SQL functions, for an operator whose api is down (`psql -f
   sql/partitions.sql`, then `select * from repose_partitions_maintain();`).

## Locally

```
docker compose -f ops/dev/docker-compose.yml up -d
go run ./ops/dev/seedmetrics          # plausible values for every family
ops/dev/seedlogs.sh                   # a few lines of the documented shape into Loki
ops/dev/pgcheck.sh                    # schema, synthetic samples, every panel's SQL
```

Grafana is then on `http://<this box's Tailscale address>:3000` (anonymous
admin, folder `repose`); Prometheus on `:9090`. `ops/check.sh --grafana` does
the same thing non-interactively and asserts that seven of the eight
dashboards loaded (it does not check the overview).

`docker compose -f ops/dev/docker-compose.yml down -v` removes it, volumes
included.

## What is checked, and what only a host can tell you

`ops/check.sh` covers: the rules parse; each alert fires on its own fixture;
every alert has a runbook heading; the dashboards match the generator; every
panel has a title, a description, a provisioned datasource and a query; no
Prometheus query selects on `project_id`, `guest_id` or `user_id`; every SQL
query names tables and columns that `db-schema.md` has; every Prometheus
expression parses. With `--grafana`, that Grafana accepts seven of them (not the overview).

`ops/dev/pgcheck.sh` runs every Postgres panel query against a real
Postgres and makes one partition drop happen.

What none of that shows: whether a real host's values are sensible, whether
Fluent Bit reaches the real Loki, and whether the alert thresholds are the
right ones for this fleet. Those are the real-host items in
`docs/workstreams/10-observability.md` §9.
