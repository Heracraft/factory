# M3 step 6 (docs/workstreams/PROMPTS.md "M3 bring-up / m3"): the boundary
# table of docs/workstreams/14-security.md §5 as a test on host-01, with
# two guests of two users. It fills the REPOSE_ISOLATION_* environment
# test/isolation/doc.go lists and runs the Go suite; a row whose inputs are
# missing skips by name, so read the summary, not the exit code alone.
#
# Where the scripts run:
#   guest A (the owner's PROJECT)   through the gateway, as the user, with
#                                   the certificate `repose run` wrote
#   guest B (PROJECT_B, the second  `repose-admin exec` (audited, as dev);
#   person's project)               the second person's own certificate is
#                                   only needed by the gateway rows, as
#                                   LOGIN_B, and never leaves their laptop
#   the host                        root over the edge's operator sshd
#
# Also here, because the Go suite has no row for them: the operator password
# attempt (14 §9 "a password attempt is logged"), and the note that "hostd for
# host X cannot act on host Y" needs a second host.
