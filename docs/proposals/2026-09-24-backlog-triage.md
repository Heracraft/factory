# Backlog triage: the owner's open notes (proposal, 2026-09-24)

**Status: analysis only. Nothing here is decided.** Each item below is an
unticked line from the owner's personal notes. For each one, this file
records what the repo has today (with file references), what outside
research found, and a recommendation. An item becomes real only through a
`DECISIONS.md` entry. The Claude login item has its own file:
`2026-09-24-claude-login-shared-folder.md`.

Sources:
- Repo state as of `a2aad99` on local main. Local main was 10 commits ahead of
  origin: I-238..I-241 were merged but not pushed.
- Web research done on 2026-09-24. Each claim cites its URL. Anything
  marked *unverified* was not confirmed.
- `2026-09-23-dev-ergonomics.md`, which already covers items 3, 7, 8, 9
  and 13 of the earlier list.

## Summary

| # | Item | Today | Recommendation |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | Vercel CLI and portless preinstalled | Menu entries plus tools carry | Close it. No base change |
| 2 | Voice mode | Nothing | Drop it. It can't work over SSH |
| 3 | Image paste | OSC 52 copy-out only | Build `repose paste` |
| 4 | Preview URLs | Designed, not built | Make it next after M5 |
| 5 | Quick path to production | Deferred (item 13, 09-23) | Keep deferred |
| 6 | Log into Claude once for N projects | Open | See the separate file. Not a blocker for the invite beta |
| 7 | Home page additions | Partly on the page | Add only what is live |
| 8 | Test the browser features | VM tests only | Deploy I-241, then run the real-guest rows |
| 9 | Try exe.dev | — | Owner, priority 1. Test plan below |
| 10 | Something special because it's a microVM | — | Not alone. `repose fork` is the idea |
| 11 | `bypassPermissions` as the default | Docs tell users to set it | Set it in the guest baseline |
| 12 | Several runs of one project | `--name` plus one `-2` window | Allow any number of windows. Consider `repose fork` |

---

## 1. Vercel CLI and portless preinstalled

**Today**
- Both are opt-in menu entries in group `deploy`:
  `internal/menu/catalog.yaml:278` (vercel) and `:292` (portless).
- Proposal 09-23 item 3 says "agreed: no base change".
- The tools carry (I-221) reinstalls the laptop's global npm tools. Its test
  fixtures include both (`internal/cli/carry_tools_test.go:76,81`).
- The project scan (I-222) maps `portless` to its package.
- Vercel's login file is carried (`internal/cli/creds.go:28`).
- Auto-forward never silently remaps portless's port 1355
  (`internal/cli/forward.go:43`, I-199).

**Research: portless** (https://github.com/vercel-labs/portless)
- `portless myapp next dev` gives the app a random `PORT` between 4000 and
  4999.
- A local proxy on 443 (HTTP/2, with a local CA added to the trust store,
  loopback only) serves it at `https://myapp.localhost`.
- It also has `--lan`, `--tailscale` and `--ngrok` modes and an agent skill.

**Analysis** (reasoning, not from docs)
- Random ports don't suit per-port `ssh -L`.
- Forwarding the proxy port does work, because the browser sends
  `Host: myapp.localhost`. But the guest's CA isn't trusted on the laptop,
  and binding local 443 needs privileges.
- portless fits hostname-routed preview URLs (item 4) better than SSH
  forwarding.

**Recommendation:** close it. If portless users complain, the fix is
item 4, not a base change.

## 2. Voice mode

**Today:** nothing. Proposal 09-23 item 8 said "build nothing, OS
dictation instead; Remote Control may cover it; verify".

**Research** (https://code.claude.com/docs/en/voice-dictation.md)
- Voice needs "a local microphone: voice dictation does not work in cloud
  sessions or SSH sessions".
- It also needs a claude.ai login, not an API key or setup-token.
- On a headless host it fails with "SoX could not open an audio capture
  device".

**Recommendation:** drop it as a repose feature. The paths that remain:
- OS dictation on the laptop, which types into the terminal.
- Remote Control from the Claude phone app. That needs a full `/login` in
  the guest, which is one more reason the login must not be a setup-token
  (see the login file).

## 3. Image paste

**Today**
- Only copy-out: `set -g set-clipboard on` (`nix/guest/base/tmux.nix:62`),
  tested at `nix/guest/tests/default.nix:252`.
- Proposal 09-23 item 8 rejected a clipboard socket into the guest.
- It proposed, but did not build, a CLI pty proxy that uploads images.

**Research**
- Ctrl+V reads the clipboard of the machine that runs Claude, so remote
  paste fails.
- The OSC 52 / OSC 5522 image-paste request was closed as not planned:
  https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code/issues/42712
- Every community workaround copies the file across and pastes its path,
  which Claude attaches:
  - clipssh (https://github.com/samuellawrentz/clipssh)
  - claude-ssh-image-skill over a reverse tunnel
    (https://github.com/AlexZeitler/claude-ssh-image-skill)
  - a VS Code Remote-SSH extension
  - plain scp
- Theo names "no image paste" as one reason SSH workflows are broken
  (item 16).

**Recommendation:** build `repose paste`.
1. Read the image on the laptop's clipboard (`pngpaste` or `osascript` on
   macOS, `wl-paste` or `xclip` on Linux).
2. Copy it over the existing ControlMaster to `/tmp/repose-paste/<ts>.png`.
3. Type the path into the active pane with `tmux send-keys`.

This reuses `repose cp` (I-201) plumbing and needs no socket into the guest.
A terminal key binding that runs it is optional, documented rather than
shipped.

## 4. Preview URLs

**Today**
- Auto-forward while attached (I-199, which rejected preview URLs as the
  dev path) and `repose open PORT`: `docs/features/ports-and-previews.md:8-86`.
- The later design is at `ports-and-previews.md:120-160` (R2-6, I-6):
  - `<port>-<slug>-<handle>.repose.herakraft.co`
  - wildcard TLS on the edge
  - Logto cookie, owner-only by default
  - `preview: public`
  - 100 req/s cap
- Not built: no gateway HTTPS listener, no DNS.
- It is first on the MILESTONES "Later" list.
- User docs say there are no public URLs and suggest `cloudflared`
  (`apps/web/src/content/docs/machine.md:92`).

**Research:** every comparable product has previews, private by default
with an explicit public toggle.

| Product | URL | Default access | Public |
|---|---|---|---|
| exe.dev | `vm.exe.xyz[:port]` | exe login | `share set-public`, one port; email and link shares ([proxy](https://exe.dev/docs/proxy.md), [sharing](https://exe.dev/docs/sharing.md)) |
| Sprites | `name-orgid.sprites.app` | bearer token | `sprite url update --auth public` ([networking](https://docs.sprites.dev/concepts/networking/)) |
| Codespaces | `NAME-PORT.app.github.dev` | private | org or public per port ([docs](https://docs.github.com/en/codespaces/developing-in-a-codespace/forwarding-ports-in-your-codespace)) |
| Coder | `PORT--agent--ws--user--apps.host` | owner | authenticated or public ([docs](https://coder.com/docs/admin/networking/port-forwarding)) |

**Recommendation:** make this the first thing after M5. It's also what lets
you check an app from a phone, and it gives portless (item 1) a home. The
existing design already matches the market pattern.

## 5. Quick path to production

**Today**
- Proposal 09-23 item 13 deferred it: "Repose should not host production";
  the idea is a base skill that deploys to the user's own Vercel, Coolify or
  Fly.
- The menu has wrangler, supabase, flyctl and vercel. ngrok is on the unfree
  allowlist (`nix/guest/unfree-allowlist.nix:5`).

**Recommendation:** keep it deferred until the invite beta shows people
asking for it.

## 6. Log into Claude once for N projects

See `2026-09-24-claude-login-shared-folder.md`. In short:
- Anthropic's terms forbid a platform that collects, stores or
  intermediates Claude.ai credentials. That rules out the stored
  setup-token fallback and CLI copying.
- A per-user shared folder holding only `.credentials.json` is the
  candidate. It needs two experiments and a question to Anthropic.
- One login per new project is acceptable for a handful of invited users,
  so this does not block the beta.

## 7. Home page additions

**Today:** `apps/web/src/routes/+page.svelte`, hero "Let your agents run
with full permissions" (see memory: positioning). Extras at `:66-78`:

| Proposed line | On the page? |
|---|---|
| Dev server on localhost | Yes |
| Headless Chromium and Playwright, plus `repose open --desktop` | Yes; "take over" is not stated |
| Docker works | Yes |
| Config changes without a reboot | No |
| Agent status at a glance with cost today | No |

The `web/landing-page` branch has copy for the missing two: `:86` "no
reboot for packages", `:111` "Docker and databases", `:184` "`repose
status` shows… cost so far today", "Five agents, one notification feed".

**Recommendation:** add the two missing lines only after checking each is
live and documented under `/docs` (rule: no ghost features). Keep the
three-column shape agreed on 09-23.

## 8. Test the browser features

**Today**
- `nix/guest/base/browser.nix`: chromium, playwright-mcp and
  chrome-devtools-mcp, both headless, in `/etc/repose/mcp.json`.
- `nix/overlay/agents/agent-setup.nix:8,54-60` merges them into
  `~/.claude.json`.
- `repose-browser.slice` caps memory at 37.5% of the guest (`:84-91`).
- `repose open --desktop` / `--stop` goes through `repose-guest-profile`
  (I-241, `internal/cli/open.go`). Before I-241 it called a unit that
  didn't exist.
- `repose browser bridge` is planned only (`docs/features/browser.md:81`).
- VM tests in `nix/guest/tests/default.nix`:
  - mcpServers present (`:280`)
  - Playwright seed (`:801-819`)
  - desktop chain on 6080, VNC password, 30-minute idle stop (`:859-892`)
  - headless screenshot (`:895-903`)
- No test covers the memory cap. No CI runs the VM tests.
- Real-guest rows are open in `docs/workstreams/02-guest-base.md:348-361`
  and in `CHECKLIST-AUDIT.md`.

**Recommendation**
1. Push main.
2. Release the CLI and publish the base that carries I-241, then deploy
   the web app.
3. On a real guest, record evidence for:
   - an agent-driven headless screenshot of a live page;
   - both MCP servers answering with no network beyond the page;
   - `open --desktop`, then a headed browser launched by the agent,
     then the user clicking in it, then `--desktop --stop`;
   - a runaway tab (allocate in a loop) killed by the slice while the
     agent survives.
4. Paste that evidence into the 02 checklist rows.

## 9. Try exe.dev (owner, priority 1)

**Research** (https://exe.dev/pricing, https://exe.dev/docs.md)
- **Price:** Personal is $20/month for 2 vCPU / 8 GB / 100 GB pooled across
  up to 50 VMs, with 200 GB transfer. Team is $25 per user.
- **Access:** `ssh exe.dev`, persistent VMs with root, apt and systemd.
  Claude, codex and pi are preinstalled.
- **Shelley:** a web and mobile agent with a Chromium tool and a browser
  terminal.
- **Proxy:** private HTTPS by default, with sharing (see item 4).
- **Other:** `cp` clones a VM; custom domains; email; edge-injected
  secrets.
- **Not found in their docs:** snapshots or restore, Nix, a
  Claude-subscription integration (Claude access is by API key or their
  gateway).
- **Series A:** $35M, from their homepage (*unverified*).

**Where repose still differs:**
- `repose run` brings the exact working state: uncommitted edits, `.env`,
  tool logins, TZ.
- A Nix-declared machine that switches without a reboot.
- Snapshot and restore.
- Price is not one of them: $49 per project against $20 for 50 VMs.

**The owner's day on exe.dev should record:**
1. Time from a cold account to an agent working on nuru-playground with
   uncommitted changes. What was lost?
2. Opening the dev server on a phone.
3. Pasting a screenshot into Claude.
4. What happens after the laptop closes and a VM restarts.
5. Where Claude's login lives and how often it's asked for.

Then decide continue, shrink or shelve (see memory:
repose-competitive-landscape).

Fly Sprites, briefly (https://fly.io/sprites/):
- Persistent VMs that sleep; about 1 s checkpoints, automatic by default.
- `*.sprites.app` URLs.
- Agent CLIs preinstalled.
- Usage billing (CPU $0.07/h, RAM $0.04375/GB-h).

Conductor Cloud (https://www.conductor.build/docs/cloud/getting-started):
- Invite-only; Vercel Sandbox microVMs.
- "Personal subscription token or API key" for agents.
- Pricing not found.

## 10. Something special because it's a real microVM

exe.dev and Sprites are microVMs too, so the VM alone isn't a
differentiator.

**What is:** real Docker, systemd and a kernel per project, combined with
snapshot and restore and a Nix switch without a reboot. The concrete
feature that uses all of it is **`repose fork`**: snapshot a project and
start N guests from it, so N agents try N approaches from the same state,
each with full permissions. It builds on existing snapshots and restore,
and it answers item 12.

## 11. `bypassPermissions` as the default

**Today**
- Not set. The platform settings hold only the repose-hook Notification
  and Stop entries (`nix/guest/base/agents.nix:6-15`).
- User docs tell users to set it themselves on the laptop
  (`apps/web/src/content/docs/agents.md:27-40`).
- The I-196 merge (`internal/cli/claude_merge.jq:79-88`) is `$G * $L`, so a
  laptop `defaultMode` wins and the guest's value stays when the laptop has
  none.
- The guest user `dev` is non-root, partly for this
  (`nix/guest/base/users.nix:1`).

**Research** (https://code.claude.com/docs/en/permission-modes.md)
- `permissions.defaultMode: "bypassPermissions"` is honoured from user,
  `--settings` or managed settings. It is ignored from a project's
  `.claude/settings*.json`.
- The first interactive start shows a warning dialog. Accepting it writes
  `skipDangerousModePermissionPrompt: true`, which can be pre-set.
- It refuses to run as root or under sudo.
- Managed settings (`/etc/claude-code/managed-settings.json` and `.d/`)
  outrank the user, so using them would override a user who wants another
  mode. Don't use them for this.
- Even in bypass, deny rules, explicit ask rules, `rm` of critical paths
  and some cross-session prompts still apply.
- Anthropic now makes auto mode the default on Pro/Max/Team and describes
  bypass as for "isolated containers and VMs only", which is what a guest
  is.

**Recommendation**
- Add `permissions.defaultMode: "bypassPermissions"` and
  `skipDangerousModePermissionPrompt: true` to the guest's baseline user
  settings (the `$G` side of the merge). The laptop's own `defaultMode`
  still wins, which is "unless they have another default".
- It needs a decision entry, the `agents.md` / `index.md` docs changed from
  "set it yourself" to "on by default; here's how to change it", and a VM
  test that a fresh guest starts in bypass with no dialog.
- It matches the page's headline.

## 12. Several runs of one project

**Today**
- One microVM per project (R1-2), keyed on (user, remote).
- `repose run --name todo-app-experiment` gives a second guest for the same
  repo (`docs/features/projects.md:22`, I-152).
- New accounts may have 3 projects (1 xl), and 10 after the first paid
  invoice.
- Inside one guest, a second `run` opens window `<agent>-2` with a
  shared-working-tree warning (`internal/cli/tmux.go:37-48`). There is no
  `-3` and no worktree automation.
- No decision covers N agents per project.

**Recommendation**
- Allow `<agent>-N` for any N; this is small.
- Optionally offer `--worktree`, which puts each extra window on its own
  git worktree.
- For truly separate attempts, use `repose fork` (item 10).
- Would users want it? Yes: it's the "three agents, three clean machines"
  line in the positioning. Measure through the beta before building fork.

## 13. Platform CLAUDE.md / AGENTS.md

**Today**
- Nothing writes one.
- The carry copies the laptop's `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md` onto the guest
  (`internal/cli/carry_claude.go:40`), so a platform file at that path
  would be overwritten.
- Custom notifications already work: `repose-hook` accepts
  `{agent,kind,summary}` JSON on stdin and posts to
  `/run/repose/hooks.sock` (`internal/guestd/hooks/hooks.go:33`). This is
  undocumented, and there is no `repose notify` inside the guest.

**Recommendation**
- Write the platform file to Claude Code's managed memory path
  `/etc/claude-code/CLAUDE.md` (*unverified path, check the memory docs*).
  It loads alongside the user's own and the carry never touches it.
- Codex gets a global `AGENTS.md`; check each of the five agents' global
  instruction path.
- Generate both from one nix module that reads the same sources as
  `tool-list.nix`, `browser.nix` and the features list, so a new tool
  changes the text without anyone remembering to. Content:
  - the tools installed;
  - ports auto-forwarded while attached;
  - headless browser and MCP servers;
  - `repose open --desktop` (the user runs it);
  - secrets in `/run/repose/secrets`;
  - `repose notify` for asking the user something.
- Add a guest command `repose notify "<text>"` (kind `needs_input` or
  `completed`) that wraps `repose-hook`.
- Add a `CHECKLIST.md` rule: any user-visible guest feature changes the
  generated file.

## 14. cloudflared

**Research**
(https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/networks/connectors/cloudflare-tunnel/do-more-with-tunnels/trycloudflare/)
- Quick tunnels need no account and give a random `*.trycloudflare.com`
  URL.
- Limits: 200 in-flight requests, **no SSE**, testing only.
- They don't work if `~/.cloudflared/config.yaml` exists.
- Named tunnels on the user's own domain are stable.

**Recommendation:** add `cloudflared` as a menu entry in group `deploy`.
The user docs already point at it, and they should note the SSE limit.

## 15. Coolify or hosting inside a guest

**Today**
- There's no inbound path to a guest (R4-6).
- Egress is open except:
  - tcp 25 (I-238)
  - mining-pool ports (I-239)
  - 200 new flows/s, burst 2000 (I-240)
  - 200 Mbit/s shaping (I-217)
- The terms (`apps/web/src/content/legal/terms.md:48-62`) say "for software
  development" and forbid proxy/VPN/relay for others, spam, scanning and
  illegal content. They don't ban tunnels or hosting.
- Egress over 500 GB is billed.

**Recommendation:** accept it. Price already makes a guest a poor host,
egress is metered, and there's no stable IP. If the owner wants the rule
written down, add one line to the terms: "not for serving production
traffic to others". No technical block.

## 16. Private invite beta, and Theo

**Today**
- No invite, waitlist or beta code. Sign-in is GitHub through Logto.
- No free tier; the trial credit is $3.36 (I-205).
- `billingGate` (`internal/api/http/projects.go:137-156`) requires a card
  before a start.
- `docs/features/projects.md` still says "cannot start a guest at all"
  without a card, while the homepage dropped card wording (c38fd3d). Check
  which is current.

**Recommendation**
- Add `users.invited` (or an invite-code table), `repose-admin invite
  <github-login>`, and a refusal `not_invited` in the same gate.
- The error code needs adding to `docs/interfaces/README.md`.
- Don't wait for item 6.

**Theo, research**
- June 2026: "~6 months from most devs moving their code agents off of
  their laptops" (https://x.com/theo/status/2071083700385955906, snippet
  only).
- Setup: an always-on Mac Mini driven through the T3 Code web UI over
  Tailscale, with the laptop as a thin client (podcast summary,
  https://finance.biggo.com/podcast/c7c3cb2193d150d2, secondary source).
- He previously ran about 30 tmux sessions on a Linux box and now calls
  SSH/terminal workflows "structurally wrong", citing sticky keys and no
  image paste (secondary summary).
- T3 Code can SSH to a host and install its server component there
  (https://github.com/pingdotgg/t3code/blob/main/docs/user/remote-access.md).
- He called Fly the host least likely to survive the year
  (https://fly.io/blog/kurt-scott-money-sprites/).
- No flake.nix or NixOS setup of his was found. The owner's note says they
  saw one; the link is needed.
- **Pitch:** repose as the box behind T3 Code, a per-project disposable
  VM with snapshots, where T3 Code's server runs. This is *untested*:
  first check that T3 Code's remote install works against a repose guest
  over `ssh <project>.repose`.
