# Claude login once per user: the shared credential folder (proposal, 2026-09-24)

**Status: decided and built, DECISIONS I-278 (2026-09-26).** Experiment A
passed (file bind mount), B passed its forced tests and 7 hours of its
long run before the owner ended it to ship, and C (Anthropic's answer) was
not waited for. Below is the record of how it got there. This continues item 9 of
`2026-09-23-dev-ergonomics.md` ("users logging in N times is not
acceptable"). If it goes ahead, it needs a `DECISIONS.md` entry and a
`SECURITY.md` note, because it adds a place a secret lives. CLAUDE.md
says secrets have three homes.

## Where things stand

- **Today:** the user runs `/login` inside each guest (R2-8 amended,
  R2-15). The login persists on the guest volume, so it's one login per
  project.
- **The CLI:** it detects a missing `~/.claude/.credentials.json` and
  attaches instead of sending the prompt (`internal/cli/tmux.go:52-62`,
  `run.go:471`).
- **The fallback:** R2-15 documents `claude setup-token` stored as the
  `CLAUDE_CODE_OAUTH_TOKEN` named secret. `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` is also
  documented.
- **Copies of a disk:** `repose fork` (I-254) and `snapshots restore
  --as-new` copy the whole volume, so a login made in the source guest
  comes along in every copy. Undecided whether that counts as copying.
- **The settings carry:** it strips `env`, `apiKeyHelper` and cloud-auth
  helpers from `settings.json` (I-196, `internal/cli/carry_claude.go:207-214`).

## What the terms say (https://code.claude.com/docs/en/legal-and-compliance)

- A hosted sandbox that preinstalls Claude Code must run the binary
  unmodified and must not remove any auth method.
- It must not pay for or intermediate usage. Each end user authenticates
  with their own credentials.
- Verbatim: *"developers may not collect, store, or intermediate Claude.ai
  credentials or session tokens — sign-in to a Claude account must
  complete through Anthropic's own flow."*
- Explicitly allowed: *"an end user signing in to the unmodified Claude
  Code binary with their own Claude subscription, including where a
  platform hosts Claude Code."*
- Enforcement against third-party use of subscription OAuth began in April
  2026
  (https://www.theregister.com/2026/02/20/anthropic_clarifies_ban_third_party_claude_access/).

**What this rules out:**
- The stored setup-token fallback (R2-15): repose storing the token in
  Postgres is "store". **R2-15 should be revisited on its own** whatever
  happens here.
- The CLI copying `.credentials.json` from the laptop to a guest, or from
  one guest to another: plausibly "intermediate".

The setup-token also loses Remote Control, claude.ai connectors and
`/schedule`: "it can only make model requests"
(https://code.claude.com/docs/en/authentication). Remote Control from the
phone app is the only voice path, since voice dictation doesn't work over
SSH. So a full `/login` is the login worth keeping in any case.

## The idea: one shared folder per user, holding only the credential file

The owner proposed this on 2026-09-24. Each user gets one folder on the
host, shared into every one of that user's guests. Claude Code's
credential file lives there.

- The user signs in once, through Anthropic's own flow, in any guest.
- Repose code never reads, copies, moves or proxies the file. It
  provides storage that the user's own guests share, like a home directory
  mounted on several of the user's machines.
- The login survives destroying a project, restoring a snapshot and
  rolling back the base. The file isn't in snapshots.
- If a refresh rotates the token, every guest sees the new file, so
  rotation may stop being a problem (experiment B).

### Rule: share the credential file only, never all of `~/.claude`

`~/.claude/settings.json` holds hooks, and hooks run commands. If the whole
folder were shared, a full-permission agent in project A could write a hook
that runs in every other project of that user. That breaks the headline
promise that other projects are out of reach. It would also clash with the
settings carry and with the per-guest `~/.claude.json`.

With only the credential file shared, the worst a rogue agent can do:
- read the token, which it can already do in its own guest;
- corrupt the file, which logs the user out in every guest. That is
  annoying but recoverable.

### One host only

The folder is on one host's disk, so guests on two hosts mean one login
per host.
- Today there's only host-01.
- Later, either schedule a user's guests onto one host, or accept one
  login per host. Both are far better than one per project.

### Cost

- A new secret location (host disk, outside any guest volume). This needs
  a decision entry and a `SECURITY.md` note, and `docs/features/secrets.md`
  must say where it is and why.
- A new writable virtiofs share per user on each guest, which is a small
  extra attack surface on the host.
- Destroying the account must delete the folder.

## Experiments (in order; each gates the next)

Use e2e projects on host-01 only, never a tenant's. The owner does any
host-side mount or switch.

### A. How does Claude Code write `.credentials.json`?

This decides whether a symlink or bind mount can work.

1. In a guest, `strace -f -e trace=openat,rename,renameat2,unlink,symlink
   -o /tmp/cc.trace claude`, then force a token refresh. Either wait past
   the access token's expiry, or edit `expiresAt` in the file to a past
   time and send a prompt.
2. Check:
   - Does it write in place, or write a temp file and rename it over the
     original?
   - Does it follow a symlink, or replace it?
3. Interpret:
   - If it renames over the file, a symlink into the shared folder is
     replaced by a local file and sharing silently stops.
   - A file bind mount makes the rename fail with EBUSY, and the refresh
     breaks.
   - The shared unit then has to be a directory Claude Code writes into.
     `CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR` pointed there would share far too much (see the
     rule above), so another way must be found or the idea fails here.
4. Record the result, with the Claude Code version, in this file.

**Result (2026-09-26, Claude Code 2.1.280, guest e2e-cc-a on host-01):
a file bind mount works; a symlink does not.** A refresh was forced by
setting `expiresAt` to 1000 in place, then `claude -p` was run under
`strace -f -e trace=openat,rename,…`. Traces are in the guest under
`~/cc-exp/`.

- **Plain file.** Claude Code opens `~/.claude/.credentials.json.tmp.<hex>`
  (`O_WRONLY|O_CREAT|O_EXCL`, 0600) in the same directory, renames it over
  the file, then chmods it 0600. The inode changes (525571 → 525619).
- **Symlink into a shared dir.** The same rename replaces the symlink with
  a regular local file. The shared file keeps the stale token (still
  `expiresAt=1000`). Sharing stops silently, as feared.
- **File bind mount** (`mount --bind <shared>/.credentials.json
  ~/.claude/.credentials.json`). The rename fails with `EBUSY`. Claude Code
  then falls back to writing in place: `openat(…/.credentials.json,
  O_WRONLY|O_CREAT|O_NONBLOCK|O_NOFOLLOW)`, write, unlink the temp file,
  chmod. The inode stays 525619, and the shared file holds the refreshed
  token. The prompt succeeded.

**What this means for the design:**
- The guest mounts the share and bind-mounts one file,
  `<share>/.credentials.json`, over `~/.claude/.credentials.json`. The rest
  of `~/.claude` stays local, as the rule above requires.
- The file must exist before the bind mount, and the mount must be in
  place before the first `/login`.
- The fallback write is not atomic. Another guest reading during it can see
  a truncated file, which Claude Code treats as corrupt (no login) for that
  read. B measures whether that ever shows.
- Because of `O_NOFOLLOW`, the fallback refuses a symlink at the path.
- The fallback is undocumented Claude Code behaviour. A release that drops
  it breaks sharing: every refresh would fail with `EBUSY`. So the release
  base needs a check that repeats this trace for each Claude Code version
  bump.

### B. Do two guests on one file stay logged in?

This is the rotation question.

1. Hand-mount one host directory into two e2e guests. Place it so Claude
   Code's credential file is the shared one, per A's result.
2. Log in once in guest 1. Start `claude` in both, and send a prompt in
   each every 30 minutes for over 24 hours, so several access tokens
   expire.
3. Record:
   - Does either guest ever get logged out or hit a 401 it doesn't
     recover from?
   - After guest 1 refreshes, does guest 2's running session pick up the
     new token (re-read after a 401), or does it need a restart?
4. Also test two guests refreshing at the same moment (force both expired,
   prompt both). File locking over virtiofs is limited. The acceptable
   result is at worst one logout, never a corrupt file that needs manual
   repair.

**Setup (2026-09-26):**
- Two e2e guests on host-01: e2e-cc-a (Claude Code 2.1.280) and e2e-cc-b
  (2.1.281; built after base 2026.09.26.1).
- On the host, `/var/lib/repose/exp-cc-auth` (0700, uid 1000) is served by
  one root virtiofsd per guest (`--sandbox chroot --cache never`) and
  hot-plugged as tag `cc-auth` with `ch-remote add-fs`. hostd is untouched.
- Each guest mounts the tag at `/mnt/cc-auth` and bind-mounts
  `/mnt/cc-auth/.credentials.json` over `~/.claude/.credentials.json`.
- Scripts and traces are in the session scratchpad, `exp-b-host.sh` and
  `exp-b.sh`; the per-guest log is `~/cc-exp/b.log`.

**Interim results (2026-09-26 20:30Z):**
- **One login served both guests.** The owner ran `/login` once in
  e2e-cc-a. It wrote through the bind mount (same host inode, no local
  file). `claude -p` in e2e-cc-b then worked with no login of its own.
- **Rotation, sequential.** The token was expired in the shared file and
  e2e-cc-a prompted, so e2e-cc-a refreshed. e2e-cc-b's already-running
  interactive session then answered 10 s later with no restart.
- **Rotation, simultaneous.** Three rounds of: expire the token, then prompt
  both running sessions at the same moment. All six prompts answered. The
  file parsed afterwards with a refresh token present. No logout, no
  corruption.
- **Long run, ended early by the owner at 2026-09-27 03:30Z (7 h).** One
  interactive session per guest, prompted every 30 min: 19 of 19 prompts
  answered in each guest, no logout, no 401, the file valid and the same
  inode throughout. No access token expired on its own in that window: the
  last forced refresh (the claude-auth-trace.sh run at 21:17Z) set expiry to
  04:16Z. A natural expiry across guests is therefore first seen in
  production; the forced refreshes above are the same code path.

**New finding: first-run onboarding asks for a login anyway.**
- A guest whose `~/.claude.json` lacks `hasCompletedOnboarding` starts
  interactive `claude` with the theme picker, then "Select login method".
  This happens even though valid shared credentials are present and
  `claude -p` works. Esc does not skip it.
- With `hasCompletedOnboarding: true` set in the guest's own
  `~/.claude.json`, Claude goes straight to the folder-trust dialog, then
  the prompt, signed in ("Claude Pro") from the shared file.
- So the build must also seed that flag in a new guest's `~/.claude.json`.
  It is an onboarding flag, not a credential, and no auth method is
  removed: `/login` still works.
- Otherwise the user would log in again in every new project, which is
  what this proposal exists to prevent.

### C. Ask Anthropic

Only if A and B pass. Send one email describing exactly this design: the
user logs in through Anthropic's flow; the file stays on storage only that
user's VMs share; repose never reads, copies or transmits it; the unmodified
binary. Ask whether this counts as "store or intermediate". Keep the answer
in this file.

## If it fails

The best remaining experience is one click per new project:
- a `BROWSER` shim plus auto-forward (09-23 item 5), so the authorize page
  opens on the laptop;
- the user clicks once, and the login stays with the project for life.

Check whether Claude Code honours `BROWSER` over SSH; it falls back to
"Paste code here" otherwise.

Several agents in one project's guest (windows in one tmux session) share
one login, so the pain is proportional to projects, not agents.

Either way, **this does not block the private invite beta**: one click per
new project is fine for a handful of invited users.

## If it passes: build sketch

1. hostd creates `/var/lib/repose/users/<user_id>/claude-auth/`, mode
   0700 and owned by the guest's mapped uid, when the user's first guest
   starts.
2. hostd shares it into each of the user's guests as a read-write virtiofs
   tag.
3. The guest mounts it and arranges the credential file per A's result.
4. Reconcile at hostd start, following the idempotency rule in CLAUDE.md.
5. Account deletion removes the folder.
6. The CLI's missing-credentials check (`tmux.go:52-62`) still applies, now
   true for all of a user's projects after one login.
7. Tests:
   - a VM test with two guests sharing the folder;
   - a test that `settings.json` is *not* shared;
   - a live run of experiment B on the release base.
