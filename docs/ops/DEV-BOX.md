# The dev box

`woker-1` in resource group `dev-cluster`, `Standard_D8alds_v7` (AMD, 8 vCPU,
16 GB), East US, Tailscale `100.89.156.32`. This is where docs are written,
agents run, and Go and Nix builds happen. It is **not** a Repose host: it is
an AMD size and cannot tell you anything about nested virtualization.

## The Nix store lives on the temp disk

The OS disk is 30 GB, which a swarm of agents building guest closures fills
in an afternoon. The size comes with a 440 GB local temp disk (`nvme1n1`)
that is fast and free, so `/nix` is bind-mounted from it:

```
/dev/nvme1n1  ->  /mnt/nixstore  -bind->  /nix
```

Set up by `sudo scripts/nix-store-on-tempdisk.sh`, which is idempotent.

**What "temp disk" means.** It is scratch space on the physical server the
VM is currently running on, not a disk that belongs to the VM. A reboot from
inside the VM keeps it. **Stopping or deallocating the VM from Azure, or an
Azure maintenance move, brings it back empty.** Everything in the Nix store
is a cache that rebuilds from `nix/flake.lock`, so nothing is lost except
time: expect 10 to 20 minutes of downloads to get a guest closure back.

**After a deallocate**, `nix` itself is gone (it lived in the store). Run:

```
sudo scripts/nix-store-on-tempdisk.sh
```

It reformats the blank disk, remounts, and reinstalls Nix. Then `nix develop
./nix` again. Anything in `~/.cache/nix` and `~/go` is on the OS disk and
survives.

**Do not put anything that matters on `/mnt/nixstore`** other than the
store. Worktrees, the repo, `~/.azure`, `~/.config` all stay on the OS disk.

If the box gets resized to a size without a local disk (no `d` after the
size number, e.g. `D8as_v7`), the script refuses at step 0; move `/nix` back
to the OS disk first (`umount /nix; mv /mnt/nixstore /nix` with the OS disk
grown to fit).

## Azure CLI here

`az` is not installed on the box. `nix develop ./nix` provides it, as does
`nix shell nixpkgs#azure-cli`. Login is the copied `~/.azure` from a laptop
browser login, because security defaults block device-code login from a
browserless VM. The refresh token lasts about 90 days of inactivity.

## Free space

Keep 40 GB free on `/nix` before launching a wave of agents; `df -h /nix`.
`nix-collect-garbage -d` reclaims old closures; it never touches anything
the current flake lock references once rebuilt.

## VM tests need KVM

`nix flake check ./nix` runs the host NixOS VM tests (`nix/hosts/tests`).
They are declared as needing the `kvm` builder feature; without it Nix
refuses to build them, and without `/dev/kvm` access they would crawl
under emulation. One-time setup on the box:

```
sudo usermod -aG kvm azureuser
echo 'system-features = nixos-test benchmark big-parallel kvm uid-range' >> ~/.config/nix/nix.conf
```

Log in again (or prefix one command with `sg kvm -c '...'`) so the group
applies. Each test boots one or two VMs and takes two to five minutes.

## Go tests and Playwright

Inside `nix develop` the temporary directory is `/tmp/nix-shell.*`, and the
tests that put unix sockets under `t.TempDir()` (tmux and vsock fakes) fail
with "File name too long" on the socket path limit. Run them with a short
one: `mkdir -p /tmp/rt && TMPDIR=/tmp/rt go test ./...`.

Playwright's downloaded Chromium does not run here (glibc mismatch). Point
the web tests at a nixpkgs one; the configs in `apps/web` read
`PLAYWRIGHT_CHROMIUM_PATH`:

```
export PLAYWRIGHT_CHROMIUM_PATH=$(nix build --no-link --print-out-paths nixpkgs#chromium)/bin/chromium
```
